Students, Courses and Tutors Scenario
The following data model is designed to hold information relating to Students,
 Student Courses and Tutors who deal with these students. 
For this scenario we need to define the following facts:

These facts define the requirements which the Database must meet and should be agreed between the Database User and the Database Designer prior to physical creation.

The draft facts have been defined as:

The Entities required should include:

Student Information
Courses
Student Courses
Employees (Tutors)
Contact Information (Contact between the Student and the Tutor by e-mail, phone, projects etc.)
Contact Types (e-mail, phone, projects, assessments)
The Entities are related as follows:

One Student can enroll on One or Many Courses
One Course can have One or Many Students enrolled on it.
One Student can have zero, one or many forms of Contact with the Course Tutor
One Employee (Tutor) can deal with many Contacts
One Contact Type (Phone, E-mail, Assessments, Projects etc.) can have zero, one or many Contacts
The design allows a Student to enroll on multiple Courses, with a Course having many Students enrolled upon it. The Student may be in contact with the Course Tutor many times using many different forms of Contact. A Tutor will deal with many contacts involving many Students.

When asking questions of the database we may need to know:

How many Students are enrolled on a particular Course?
Which Students are due to expire shortly?
When was the last contact made between a particular Student and a Tutor?
How many Students do we have from a particular County?
Which Course is the most popular?
How many currently enrolled Students do we have?
The following data model allows these questions to be answered and allows the information contained above to be stored logically and in a structured manner.
